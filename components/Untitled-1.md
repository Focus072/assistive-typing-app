UI FEATURE BUILD — START.

Objective:
Improve [ONE specific UI goal].

Constraints:
- One branch only.
- No backend or logic changes.
- No new libraries.
- No refactors unrelated to the UI goal.
- Preserve existing behavior and functionality.

Scope:
- List the exact components/files allowed to change.

Design rules:
- Favor spacing, alignment, and hierarchy over effects.
- Avoid “over-design.”
- Small, reversible changes only.

Before coding:
1. Restate the UI goal in one sentence.
2. List the files that will be touched.
3. Describe what will visually change (no code yet).

Wait for confirmation before proceeding.
