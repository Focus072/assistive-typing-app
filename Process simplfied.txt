Process simplified
=================

Use this as your order of work so updates stay safe and organized.


THE THREE STAGES
----------------

  Local       = App runs only on your computer (npm run dev). Nobody else sees it.
  Testing     = A Preview URL from Vercel when you push a branch (not main). You check it before going live.
  Production  = The live site everyone uses. Only updates when you merge into main.


HOW TO WORK (IN ORDER)
----------------------

1. Never edit directly on main.
   main = Production. Keep it clean.

2. Create a new branch for each update (one goal per branch):
   - Open terminal in your project folder.
   - Run: git checkout main
   - Run: git pull
   - Run: git checkout -b your-branch-name
   (Use a short name like fix-typo-homepage or update-pricing-text.)

3. Work locally
   - Edit your files in Cursor.
   - Run: npm run dev
   - Check everything in the browser on your computer.

4. Send your branch to Testing
   - Commit and push:
     git add .
     git commit -m "Short description of the change"
     git push -u origin your-branch-name
   - Vercel will build your branch and give you a Preview (Testing) URL.
   - Open that URL and confirm everything looks good.

5. Update Production only when Testing looks good
   - Merge your branch into main (e.g. via GitHub Pull Request, or in terminal):
     git checkout main
     git merge your-branch-name
     git push origin main
   - Vercel will deploy main to Production. Users see the change then.


ONE-LINE SUMMARY
----------------

Local (your PC) → create branch → edit → push = Testing URL → check it → merge to main = Production.


VERCEL SETUP (ONE-TIME)
-----------------------

- In Vercel: Project → Settings → Git
- Connect your Git repository if not already connected.
- Set Production Branch to: main
- Leave Preview enabled for other branches.

Then: push any other branch = Testing. Push/merge to main = Production.


IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
-----------------------

- Production broken after a merge: In Vercel dashboard, Deployments → find the last good one → Promote to Production (rollback).
- Testing looks wrong: Do not merge. Fix on the same branch, push again, check the new Preview URL.


REMEMBER
--------

- One goal per branch.
- Always work on a branch, never on main.
- Check Testing before merging to main.
