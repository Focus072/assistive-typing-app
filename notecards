🔁 THE EXACT ORDER (STEP-BY-STEP)
🟢 STEP 1 — FEATURE BUILD — START

This is always first when changing UI or behavior.

You paste this:

FEATURE BUILD — START.

We are starting a new feature.

Before writing or changing any code:

1. Ask for (or create) a new branch name specific to this feature.
2. Restate the feature objective in ONE clear sentence.
3. List the exact components or files that will be modified.
4. List any files or areas that must NOT be touched.
5. State whether this feature requires client components ("use client") and why.
6. Confirm no refactors or redesigns beyond the header will be done.

Wait for confirmation before proceeding.


Cursor should respond with something like:

Branch: feature-home-header

Objective: “Update the home page header layout and styling”

Files: app/page.tsx, components/header.tsx

Will NOT touch: auth, routing, footer, etc.

👉 You confirm.

🟡 STEP 2 — WORK

Now Cursor codes only what was agreed:

Header only

No extra files

No “while I’m here”

You let it finish.

🔴 STEP 3 — STOP / CLOSE — COMMIT & MERGE

The moment it finishes and says “done”, “fixed”, or “ready”:

You paste:

STOP.

Based only on the work just completed in this branch:

1. State the single issue this branch solved (one sentence).
2. List the files that were changed.
3. Suggest exactly ONE commit message.

Then:
- Create a commit on this branch using that message.
- Merge this branch into `main`.
- Delete the branch.
- Do not make any additional changes.

After completing the merge, wait.

🔐 THAT’S IT. NO EXTRA STEPS.
❌ WHAT YOU DO NOT DO

Don’t stack multiple UI changes

Don’t “also tweak the footer”

Don’t start another task before STOP

Don’t commit multiple features together

🏀 BASKETBALL COMPARISON (LOCK THIS IN)

FEATURE BUILD — START → Coach calls the play

WORK → Execute the play

STOP → Whistle, score, reset

Then you call a new play if needed.

🧠 GOLDEN RULE

One prompt opens the task. One prompt closes it. Nothing in between.

You now have a repeatable, professional workflow.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New rule to add to your workflow (VERY IMPORTANT)

After any STOP / MERGE:

🔍 Always verify in this order:

Local

git status


Ahead check

git log origin/main..main --oneline


Push

git push origin main


GitHub UI

Open the file

Confirm the change exists

If step 4 doesn’t show it → it doesn’t exist.

((Approved. Proceed with the change exactly as described.))

END OF BRANCH


STOP.

Based only on the work just completed in this branch:

1. State the single issue this branch solved (one sentence).
2. List the files that were changed.
3. Suggest exactly ONE commit message.

Then perform these steps IN ORDER:

1. Commit the changes on this branch using the suggested message.
2. Merge this branch into local `main`.
3. Push `main` to `origin/main` (GitHub) so the change is visible on GitHub.
4. Delete the feature branch locally and on origin.

Do NOT make any additional changes.

After confirming the push to GitHub is complete, wait.
A branch is not done until GitHub shows the change on main.
